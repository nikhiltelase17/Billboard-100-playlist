# Billboard 100 Playlist Automation with Python

## Overview

This Python script automates the creation of a personalized Spotify playlist based on the Billboard 100 chart for a specific date. The script uses the Spotipy library to interact with the Spotify API and a custom song list scraper to extract Billboard 100 data.

## Features

1. **User Input:** The script prompts the user for a specific date (in the format YYYY-MM-DD) to travel back in time to their favorite musical era.

2. **Billboard 100 Scraping:** It scrapes the Billboard 100 chart for the specified date, extracting the top 100 songs.

3. **Spotify Song Search:** The script searches for corresponding songs on Spotify based on title and year.

4. **Playlist Creation:** It creates a new Spotify playlist named after the specified date and "Billboard" for easy reference.

5. **Playlist Population:** All the found songs are added to the created playlist, providing a seamless listening experience.
